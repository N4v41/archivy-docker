#   networks: # If you are using a reverse proxy, you will need to edit this file to add Archivy to your reverse proxy network. You can also remove the host-to-container port mapping, as that should be handled by the reverse proxy
    ports:
      - 5000:5000 # this is a host-to-container port mapping. If your Docker environment already uses the host's port `:5000`, then you can remap this to any `<port>:5000` you need
    environment:
      - FLASK_DEBUG=0 # this sets the level of verbosity printed to the Archivy container's logs
